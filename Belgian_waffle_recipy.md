# HOMEMADE BELGIAN WAFFLE RECIPE:

## Belgian Waffles vs Regular Waffles:
Belgian waffles are thicker and often larger than regular waffles because they are made with a waffle iron that has deeper grids.  These deep pockets are perfect for holding delicious pools of syrup.

The batter for Belgian waffles usually has a leavening agent. Our secret ingredient for waffles that are crisp on the outside, but light and soft in the center is to fold in beaten egg whites into the batter.



### How to Make Belgian Waffles:
Combine Dry Ingredients: In a small bowl mix the flour, baking powder, and salt together.

Whip Egg Whites: 
Separate the egg whites and yolks into two different mixing bowls. (Be careful not to get any yellow egg yolk in with the egg whites or they wont beat to stiff peaks properly). Use a hand mixer to beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.

Make Batter: Add milk and oil to the bowl with the egg yolks and mix to combine. Add the dry ingredients and stir to combine.

Gently fold in the Egg Whites but donâ€™t over-mix the batter.

Cook Waffles: pour batter into a hot greased waffle iron.

Serve: Top these crispy Belgian waffles with my delicious homemade syrup, powdered sugar, and any kind of fruit, like bananas, or berries. You could even skip the syrup and add Nutella, jam or peanut butter.
 
### Freezing Instructions:
To Freeze: Allow waffles to cool completely, then store in a freezer-safe ziplock bag for up to 3 months. Rewarm in the toaster or microwave.
